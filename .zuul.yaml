      This job builds the nova-operator and provides it to child jobs
      It also rebuilds the openstack-operator using the updated nova operator.

      This is the base job for all nova-operator tests that will deploy
      openstack. the base job does not deploy openstack but it does use
      the nova-operator-content-provider job to provide a registry with
      built operators and installs them on a crc environment. Child jobs
      should take this deployed crc and use the installed operators to
      deploy openstack and then test it. This job will fetch the job
      output directory so child jobs can just add additional logs to that
      in there post-playbooks.
